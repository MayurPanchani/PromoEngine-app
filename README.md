Promotion Engine API for a checkout process

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As per the requirement Created Promotion Engine project with below features

- We can add/update new promotion in to the system, and we can make active or inactive promotions. This can be manage using PromotionRepository entity. For now I didnt created front end to manage promotions in database. So all the mentined Promotions are active by default in system

- We can add/update products in the system. But for testing purpose we have 4 different types of products available in the system.

- System can applies all the promotions at a time
